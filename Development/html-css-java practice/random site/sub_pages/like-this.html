      [Chorus]
      Don’t call me back
      Cause I got it like this
      One minute we alone
      Then you all for the pics
      I don't really wanna know
      What your intentions is
      Gotta dip so I slide
      Bounce back right quick
      Got snakes on my side
      Cause I got it like this
      Bad bitch ride or die
      Hold the gat on my hip
      Ride slow catch a vibe
      Cause I got it like this
      Gotta watch my backside
      Cause I got it like this
      Yeah
      <br>
      [Verse]
      Diamonds on me

      All about that action, but don’t pull up on me
      Yeah

      Don’t understand what you want from me
      I'm not everything, you want to bе
      Don’t get me twisted, movin funny
      Know I'm in your city know your hittas I'm thе go to
      You don’t want the steam, I got the smoke and the fog too
      Don’t understand the plan
      Not the man or what I go thru
      Supply and demand hold it down
      Like I'm sposed to
      <br>
      [Pre-Chorus]
      I don't think they feel me right now
      Gotta scream, they don’t hear me pipe down
      Gotta watch my back when I'm in the town
      10 toes ballet, stand my ground
      So
      <br>
      [Chorus]
      Don’t call me back
      Cause I got it like this
